Title: Worker Search Effort as an Amplification Mechanism
Abstract: It is well known that the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides
  model exhibits a strong trade-off between cyclical unemployment
  fluctuations and the size of rents to employment. Introducing endogenous
  job search effort reduces the strength of the trade-off while bringing the
  model closer to the data. Ignoring worker search effort leads to a large
  upward bias in the elasticity of matches with respect to vacancies.
  Merging the American Time Use Survey and the Current Population Survey, new
  evidence in support of procyclical search effort is presented. Average
  search effort of the unemployed is subject to cyclical composition
  biases.
