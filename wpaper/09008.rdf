Title: Credibility for Sale: the Effect of Disclosure on
Information Acquisition and Transmission
Abstract: We study the effect of disclosure on information acquisition and transmission
in a dynamic reputation model. In each period, to make a report to a client,
an expert chooses between conducting a costly investigation or channeling a
message from an interest group. We show that not disclosing the source of
the expert's report may increase the frequency of investigation by the expert.
Nevertheless, it decreases the quality of the clients' decisions. We demonstrate
that, however, when the importance of decisions vary across time, when the
interest groups are long-lived, or when the expert's clientele is growing in her
reputation, nondisclosure may improve the quality of the clients' decisions.
