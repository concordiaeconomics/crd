Title: Nominal Rigidities, Monetary Policy and Pigou Cycles
Abstract: Based on a two sector dynamic new Keynesian model with
    sticky prices, this paper makes two contributions to the Pigou cycle
    literature. First, the paper quantifies the contribution of `news
    shocks' -- signals of future productivity changes. Maximum likelihood
    estimates indicate that nondurable sector news shocks are roughly as
    volatile as contemporary shocks; in the durable good sector, the
    standard deviation of news shocks is 1/4 that of contemporaneous
    shocks. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the paper shows that the
    estimated interest rule contributes to Pigou cycles arising from
    nondurable sector news shocks. In particular, the Ramsey-optimal policy
    does not exhibit Pigou cycles while the estimated policy rule does.
    With sticky prices, intermediate good producers set current prices
    based on expected future marginal cost. The news shock implies a lower
    future marginal cost, and so nondurable goods prices start falling
    immediately. The estimated interest rate rule then prescribes a lower
    nominal interest rate, and so a fall in both the real interest rate and
    user cost of durables.  As a result, purchases of durables also
    rise. In contrast, the Ramsey-optimal policy requires a higher
    nominal interest rate because the Ramsey policy attempts to minimize
    the distortions associated with within-sector price dispersion. The
    resulting dynamics under the Ramsey policy are, then, essentially the
    opposite of those under the estimated policy. Put simply, Pigou cycles
    arise in the model precisely because the central bank accommodates
    them.
