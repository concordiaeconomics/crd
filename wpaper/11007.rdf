Title: Nominal Rigidities, Monetary  Policy and Pigou Cycles
Abstract: This paper makes two contributions to the literature. First, it
    explores the role of monetary policy in generating Pigou cycles.
    Second, the paper provides a partial resolution of the comovement
    problem associated with monetary policy shocks.  The paper estimates a
    two sector dynamic new Keynesian model with sticky prices.  The
    estimated interest rate rule allows for Pigou cycles -- an immediate
    boom in economic activity upon receipt of perfectly informative news of
    a future productivity improvement.  For Pigou cycles to occur, there
    has to be sufficient movement in durable and nondurable sector
    inflation rates to lead to a sharp increase in the relative price of
    durables following a nondurable sector news shock.  An interest rate
    rule with a larger coefficient on inflation keeps sectoral inflation
    rates closer to their steady state values, leading to a more moderate
    increase in the relative price of durables.  The Ramsey-optimal policy
    likewise dampens the movements in sectoral inflation rates and avoids
    Pigou cycles.  Thus, Pigou cycles emerge in the estimated model for the
    simple reason that the central bank accommodates them.  The paper also
    provides a partial resolution of the comovement problem: the impact
    effect of a monetary policy shock leads to positive comovement between
    the durables and nondurable sectors, as seen in the data.  The paper
    shows that the comovement problem arises when durable sector prices are
    less rigid than estimated, and the elasticity of substitution between
    durables and nondurables is higher than estimated.
