Title: Second Order Bias of Quasi-MLE for Covariance Structure Models
Abstract: Several recent papers (e.g., Newey et al., 2005; Newey and
Smith, 2004; Anatolyev, 2005) derive general expressions for the
second-order bias of the GMM estimator and its first-order equivalents
such as the EL estimator. Except for some simulation evidence, it is
unknown how these compare to the second-order bias of QMLE of covariance
structure models. The paper derives the QMLE bias formulas for this
general class of models. The
bias -- identical to the EL second-order bias under normality -- depends
on the fourth moments of data and remains the same as for EL even for
non-normal data so long as the
condition for equal asymptotic efficiency of QMLE and GMM derived in
Prokhorov (2009)
is satisfied.
