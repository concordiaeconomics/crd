Title: The Impact of Medical and Nursing Home Expenses and Social Insurance Policies on Savings and Inequality
Abstract: We consider a life-cycle model with idiosyncratic risk in labor earnings, out-of-pocket
medical and nursing home expenses, and survival. Partial insurance is available through
welfare, Medicaid, and social security. Calibrating the model to the U.S., we find
that nursing home expenses play an important role in the savings of the wealthy. In
our policy analysis, we find that elimination of out-of-pocket expenses through public
health care would reduce the capital stock by 12 percent, Medicaid and old-age welfare
programs crowd out 44 percent of savings and greatly increase wealth inequality, and
social security effects are influenced by out-of-pocket health expenses.
