Title:  Why Did the Average Duration of Unemployment Become So Much Longer?
Abstract:  This paper examines the causes of the observed increase in the average unemployment
duration over the past thirty years. First we analyze if changes in the demographic com-
position of the U.S. labor force can explain this increase. In particular, we examine how
much of the observed change can be explained by the change in age and gender compo-
sition. We then consider institutional changes, such as the change in the generosity and
coverage of unemployment insurance. Changes in the composition of the labor force and
institutional changes can only partially account for the observed increase in the duration
of unemployment. We construct a job search model and calibrate it to the U.S. data.
The results indicate that more than 70% of the increase in the duration of unemployment
over the last thirty years can be explained by an increase in within-group wage inequality.
