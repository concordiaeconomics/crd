Title: Bubbles and Experience: An Experiment with a Steady Inflow of New Traders
Abstract: We revisit the effect of traders' experience on price bubbles by introducing either one-third or two-thirds steady inflow of new traders in the repeated experimental asset markets. We find that bubbles are not significantly abated by the third repetition of the market with the inflow of new traders. The relative importance of experience to the formation of bubbles depends on the proportion of new traders in the market. Our findings identify a market environment where increased experience is not sufficient to eliminate price bubbles.
