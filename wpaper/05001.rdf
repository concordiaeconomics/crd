Title:  Ordinally Bayesian Incentive Compatible Stable Matchings
Abstract:  We study incentive issues related to two-sided one-to-one stable matching
problem after weakening the notion of strategy-proofness to Ordinal
Bayesian Incentive Compatibility (OBIC). Under OBIC, truthtelling is required
to maximize the expected utility of every agent, expected utility being
that everybody else is also telling the truth. We show that when preferences
are unrestricted there exists no matching procedure that is both stable and
OBIC. Next preferences are restricted to the case where remaining single is
the worst alternative for every agent. We show that in this case, if agents
matching procedures that are both stable and OBIC even with restricted
preferences.
