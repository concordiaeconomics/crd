Title: Market Work, Housework and Childcare: A Time Use Approach
Abstract:   Raising children takes considerable time, particularly for women.  Yet, the
  role of childcare time has received scant attention in the macroeconomics
  literature.  We develop a life-cycle model in which the time dimension of
  childcare plays a central role.  An important contribution of the paper is
  estimation of the parameters of a childcare production function using data
  on primary and secondary childcare time as reported in the American Time
  Use Survey (2003--2015).  The model does a better job matching the observed
  life-cycle patterns of womens' time use than a model without childcare.
  Our counterfactual experiments show that the increase in the relative wage
  of women since the 1960s is an important factor in the increase in womens'
  work time; changes in fertility associated with the baby boom play a
  smaller role, and changes in the price of durables are found to have a
  negligible effect.  We consider the effects of cheaper daycare.  Not
  surprisingly, this experiment leads to greater use of daycare and more time
  allocated to market work.  A knock-on effect of cheaper daycare is a
  substantial decline in primary childcare time.
