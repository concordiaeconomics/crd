Title:  A Two-Stage Plug-In Bandwidth Selection and Its Implementation in Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent Covariance Matrix Estimation
Abstract:  The performance of a kernel HAC estimator depends on the accuracy of the estimation of
the normalized curvature, an unknown quantity in the optimal bandwidth represented as the
spectral density and its derivative. This paper proposes to estimate it with a general class of
kernels. The AMSE of the kernel estimator and the AMSE-optimal bandwidth are derived. It
is shown that the optimal bandwidth for the kernel estimator should grow at a much slower rate
than the one for the HAC estimator with the same kernel. A solve-the-equation implementation
method is also proposed. Finite sample performances are assessed through simulations.
