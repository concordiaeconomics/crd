Title: Nominal Rigidities, Monetary  Policy and Pigou Cycles
Abstract:     Capturing the boom phase of Pigou cycles and resolving the
    comovement problem requires positive sectoral comovement.  This paper
    addresses these observations using a two sector New Keynesian model.
    Price rigidities dampen movements in the relative price of durables
    following a monetary policy shock.  Durables and nondurables are
    estimated to be complements in utility, allowing for a resolution of
    the comovement problem for modest degrees of price rigidity.  Nominal
    rigidities also make firms forward-looking in their pricing behaviour
    which leads to relative price dynamics that generate positive sectoral
    comovement in the boom phase of a Pigou cycle.
