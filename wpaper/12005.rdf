Title: Labor Force Participation and Pair-wise Efficient Contracts with
Search and Bargaining
Abstract: A "constant" wage is pair-wise inefficient in a standard search
model when workers endogenously separate from employment. We derive a
pair-wise efficient employment contract
that involves workers paying a hiring fee (or bond) upon the formation of
a match. We estimate the constant wage and pair-wise efficient contract
assuming the hiring fee is unobservable, and find evidence to reject the
pair-wise efficient contract in favor of the constant wage rule. A
counterfactual experiment reveals the current level of labor force
participation to be 9.6% below the efficient level, and a structural shift
to the pair-wise efficient contract improves welfare by roughly 3.5%.
