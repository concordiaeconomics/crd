Title: Ramsey-optimal Tax Reforms and Real Exchange Rate Dynamics
Abstract: We solve for the Ramsey-optimal path for government debt, labor
  income taxes and capital income taxes for a small open economy with an
  endogenously-determined real exchange rate.  Due to the endogenous exchange
  rate, the model must be solved using the `primal problem': maximize the
  lifetime utility of the representative household subject to equilibrium
  conditions and the government budget constraint.  The open economy
  constrains the government's setting of the capital income tax rate since
  physical capital cannot be dominated in rate of return by foreign assets.
  However, the endogenous real exchange rate loosens this constraint relative
  to a one good open economy model in which the real exchange rate is
  necessarily fixed.
