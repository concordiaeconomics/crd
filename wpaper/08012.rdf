Title: Discretization of Highly-Persistent Correlated AR(1) Shocks
Abstract: The finite state Markov-Chain approximation method developed
by Tauchen (1986) and Tauchen and Hussey (1991) is widely used in
economics, finance and econometrics in solving for functional
equations where state variables follow an autoregressive process. For
highly persistent processes, the method requires a large number of
discrete values for the state variables to produce close
approximations which leads to an undesirable reduction in
computational speed, especially in multidimensional case. This paper
proposes an alternative method of discretizing vector autoregressions.
The method works well as an approximation and its numerical efficiency
applies to a wide range of the parameter space.
