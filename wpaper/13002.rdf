Title: The Cyclicality of Search Intensity in a Competitive Search Model
Abstract: Shimer's puzzle is that the textbook
  Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model exhibits fluctuations in labor market
  variables that are an order of magnitude too small.  Introducing search
  effort of the unemployed brings the model's predictions for these
  fluctuations very close to those seen in the data.  The search cost
  function and the matching technology are intimately related and thus should
  be estimated simultaneously.  Ignoring worker search effort leads to a
  large upward bias in the elasticity of matches with respect to vacancies.
  Evidence in support of the model's prediction of procyclical search effort
  is presented.
