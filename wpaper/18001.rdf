Title: Ramsey-optimal Tax Reforms and Real Exchange Rate Dynamics
Abstract:   We solve the Ramsey-optimal tax plan for a small open economy with an
  endogenously-determined real exchange rate.  The open economy
  constrains the government's setting of the capital income tax rate since
  physical capital cannot be dominated in rate of return by foreign assets.
  However, the endogenous real exchange rate loosens this constraint relative
  to a one good open economy model in which the real exchange rate is
  necessarily fixed.  We find that, the dynamics of the two good small open
  economy model more closely resemble those of a closed economy model than a
  one good small open economy model.
