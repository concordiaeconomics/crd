Title: Key Moments in the Rouwenhorst Method
Abstract: Recent work of Galindev and Lkhagvasuren (2009) shows that for highly persistent autoregressive processes Rouwenhorst's (1995) method outperforms other existing methods in the scalar case along key lower-order moments. Although lower order moments are sufficient to evaluate the existing few methods, it is important to understand how the method performs along other moments of the underlying process. This note calculates the key higher order moments of the process generated by the Rouwenhorst method for its unrestricted, non-symmetric case. The results can also be useful in discretizing autoregressive processes whose higher-order moments are different than those of the normal distribution.
