Title: Second-order approximation of dynamic models without the use of tensors
Abstract: Several approaches to finding the second-order
  approximation to a dynamic model have been proposed recently. This paper
  differs from the existing literature in that it makes use of the Magnus
  and Neudecker (1999) definition of the Hessian matrix. The key result is
  a linear system of equations that characterizes the second-order
  coefficients. No use is made of multi-dimensional arrays or tensors, a
  practical implication of which is that it is much easier to transcribe
  the mathematical representation of the solution into usable computer
  code. Matlab code is available from
