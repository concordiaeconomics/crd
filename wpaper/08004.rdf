Title: On relative efficiency of Quasi-MLE and GMM estimators
of covariance structure models
Abstract: Optimal GMM is known to dominate Gaussian QMLE in terms of
asymptotic efficiency
(Chamberlain, 1984). I derive a new condition under which QMLE is as
efficient as GMM
for a general class of covariance structure models. The condition
trivially holds for normal data but also identifies non-normal cases for
which Gaussian QMLE is efficient.
