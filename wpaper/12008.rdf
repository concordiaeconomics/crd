Title:  Measuring the Welfare Costs of Inflation in a Life-cycle Model
Abstract:   In a neoclassical growth model with life-cycle households in which money
  is held to satisfy a cash-in-advance constraint, the optimal steady state
  inflation rate is not the Friedman rule -- it is in excess of $20\%$.
  Lump-sum, age-independent money injections twist and flatten the lifetime
  profile of utility, making this profile look more like the one that would
  be chosen by a planner.  The cost of monetary finance of lump-sum
  payments is the distortion introduced to the labor-leisure choice.
