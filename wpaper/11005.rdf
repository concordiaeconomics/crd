Title: A Moment-Matching Method for Approximating Vector
Autoregressive Processes by Finite-State Markov Chains
Abstract: This paper proposes a moment-matching method for approximating vector
autoregressions by finite-state Markov chains. The Markov chain is
constructed by targeting the conditional moments of the underlying
continuous process. The proposed method is more robust to the number of
discrete values and tends to outperform the existing methods for
approximating multivariate processes over a wide range of the parameter
space, especially for highly persistent vector autoregressions with roots
near the unit circle.
