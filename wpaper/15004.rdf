Title: A Tale of Tax Policies in Open Economies
Abstract:   To evaluate fiscal policy reforms for Euro-area
    countries, this paper develops and calibrates a small open economy model.
    Debt reduction reforms require higher tax rates in the short term in
    exchange for lower rates in the long term as the debt servicing burden
    falls. Using the capital income tax to implement such a policy leads to
    welfare gains; the consumption tax, a very small welfare gain; and the
    labor income tax, a welfare loss.  Holding fixed the long run debt-output
    ratio, offsetting a lower capital income tax with either a higher labor
    income or consumption tax generally yields welfare gains.
