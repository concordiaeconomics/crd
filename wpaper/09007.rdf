Title: How Important is Human Capital? A Quantitative Theory Assessment of World Income Inequality
Abstract: We develop a quantitative theory of human capital investments in
order to evaluate the magnitude of cross-country differences in total
factor productivity (TFP) that explains the variation in per-capita incomes
across countries. We build a heterogeneous-agent economy with
cross-sectional variation in ability, schooling, and expenditures on
schooling quality. By embedding our analysis in a growth model with
tradable and non-tradable sectors, we model sectorial productivity
differences across countries, as documented in Hsieh and Klenow (2007). The
parameters governing human capital production and random ability and taste
processes are restricted by a set of cross-sectional data moments such as
variances and intergenerational correlations of earnings and schooling, as
well as slope coefficient and R-squared in a Mincer regression. Our main
finding is that human capital accumulation strongly amplifies TFP
differences across countries: To explain a 20-fold difference in the output
per worker the model requires a 5-fold difference in the TFP of the
tradable sector, versus an 18-fold difference if human capital is fixed
across countries. Moreover, we find that sectorial productivity differences
play a prominent role in quantitative implications of the theory.
