Title: Graphic Warning Labels on Cigarette Packaging in Canada:
A Targeted Commentary on our Limited State of Knowledge
Abstract: A large group of authors with inspiring credentials recently expressed their belief, in the journal Tobacco Control, that the introduction of graphic label warnings (GLWs)on cigarette packages could reduce smoking prevalence in the US by several percentage points, in view of the evidence proposed in two research papers that such warnings may have reduced prevalence by as much as 20% in Canada. I believe this claim is overstated, and I illustrate why by digging into the data used in one of those two papers. I do not claim that GWLs have a zero impact, but I show why the medical, economics and legal communities should be circumspect in accepting the magnitude of recent claims. There remains work to be done on the Canadian data and data from other economies. This commentary is not a finished paper, but I have chosen to make public the ideas here in the hope that they may spur further exploration and debate with a view to getting a better estimate of the impact of GWLs on behavior.
