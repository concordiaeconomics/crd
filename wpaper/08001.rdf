Title:  Measuring the Welfare Costs of Inflation in a Life-cycle Model
Abstract: In macroeconomics, life-cycle models are typically used to address
  exclusively life-cycle issues. This paper shows that modeling the
  life-cycle may be important when addressing public policy issues, in this
  case the welfare costs of inflation. In the representative agent model,
  the optimal inflation rate is characterized by the Friedman rule: deflate
  at the real interest rate. In the corresponding life-cycle model, the
  optimal inflation rate is quite high: for the benchmark calibration, it
  is around 95% per annum. Much of the paper is concerned with
  understanding this result.  Briefly, in the life-cycle model there are
  distributional consequences of injecting money via lump-sum
  transfers. The net effect is to transfer income from old, rich agents to
  young, poor ones. These transfers twist the age-utility profile in a way
  that agents find desirable from a lifetime utility point of view.  A
  second issue concerns how to assess the costs of inflation in a
  life-cycle model. Metrics that are equivalent in the representative agent
  model can give very different answers in a life-cycle model.
