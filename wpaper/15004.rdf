Title: Debt Hangover in the Aftermath of the Great Recession
Abstract: Following the Great Recession, U.S. government debt levels exceeded
	100% of output.  We develop a macroeconomic model to evaluate the
	role of various shocks during and after the Great Recession; labor
	market shocks have the greatest impact on macroeconomic activity.  We
	then evaluate the consequences of using alternative fiscal policy
	instruments to implement a fiscal austerity program to return the
	debt-output ratio to its pre-Great Recession level.  Our welfare
	analysis reveals that there is not much difference between applying
	fiscal austerity through government spending, the labor income tax,
	or the consumption tax; using the capital income tax is
	welfare-reducing.
