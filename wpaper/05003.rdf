Title:  Rosenberg's "Learning by Using" and Technology Diffusion
Abstract:  This paper formulates Rosenberg's (1982) "learning by using" as a 
stochastic process. The producer of machines learns from the experience of users. 
Due to this learning, the quality of machines improves over time. It turns 
out that the process of this improvement approximately takes an exponential
form. This improvement process, combined with the growth of demand due 
to the improvement, can produce an S-shape diffusion curve of machines. 
Strong demand and advancement of communication technology increase the 
diffusion speed. The distributional property of the stochastic process and the
implications for inequality across machine users are also explored.
