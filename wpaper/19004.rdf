Title: Ramsey Tax Competition with Real Exchange Rate Determination
Abstract:     How should governments choose tax rates when they face competition from    other jurisdictions?  This questions is answered by solving for the Nash    equilibrium of the game played between Ramsey planners in a two good, two    country open economy macroeconomic model.  It is shown, analytically,    that the planers do not tax capital income in the long run.  Short term    results, obtained computationally, reveal that the government of the    larger country manages the path of the real exchange rate in order to    manipulates its smaller rival's choice of tax rates.  Tax competition    does not lead to a "race to the bottom."
