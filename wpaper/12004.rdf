Title: Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard: Quantitative Implications for
Unemployment Insurance
Abstract: I construct a dynamic contracting model of optimal unemployment
insurance with adverse selection and moral hazard that captures the
transition from unemployment to non-participation observed in the data,
which the standard moral hazard model fails to capture. My model generates
both qualitative and quantitative implications for the optimal provision
of unemployment insurance. Qualitatively, for some agents, incentives in
the optimal contract imply consumption increases over the duration of
non-employment. Quantitatively, I compare the current U.S. system to the
optimal one, and find large cost savings to adopting the optimal contract.
The optimal contract achieves an additional 46% of cost savings relative
to a planner who ignores adverse selection and focuses only on moral
hazard. I also find the current transition from unemployment to
non-participation to be efficient, and when compared to the current U.S.
system, the optimal contract implies agents experiencing a long spell of
non-participation have consumption increasing over the spell.
