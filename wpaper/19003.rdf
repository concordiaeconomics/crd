Title: Observed and Unobserved Sources of Wealth Inequality
Abstract: This paper studies the implications of observed and unobserved heterogeneity in wages across households with different education levels on wealth inequality and life-cycle savings. Using the PSID, I estimate skill-specific wage processes that allow both observed between-group wage dispersion and unobserved within-group wage dispersion. The implications of these estimated skill-specific wage processes are quantitatively studied in an incomplete-markets overlapping-generations general equilibrium model wherein households choose their education. I show that, in contrast to a model with a common wage process, the model with skill-specific wage processes explains far more wealth inequality and life-cycle wealth accumulation of skilled and unskilled households seen in data.
