Title: Sorting by Skill over the Course of Job Search
Abstract: We use novel high-frequency panel data on individuals' job
applications from an online job posting engine to study (1) whether at
the beginning of search job seekers with different levels of education
(skill) apply to different jobs, and (2) how search behavior changes
as search continues. First, we find that there is sorting by skill at
the beginning of search. Second, as search continues, job seekers
apply to different types of jobs than at the beginning of search. In
particular, assuming that sorting at the beginning of search is
positive, as search continues there is less sorting by education and
job seekers, on average, apply to lower quality jobs.
