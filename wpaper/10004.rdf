Title: How Optimism Leads to Price Discovery and Efficiency in a
Dynamic Matching Market
Abstract: We study a market search equilibrium with aggregate
uncertainty, private information and heterogeneus beiefs. Traders
initially start out optimistic and then update their beliefs based on
their matching experience in the market, using the Bayes rule. It is
shown that all separating equilibria converge to perfect competition
in the limit as the time between matches tends to 0. We also establish
existence of a separating equilibrium.
