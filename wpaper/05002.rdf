Title:  Costs of Business Cycles for Unskilled Workers
Abstract:  This paper reconsiders the cost of business cycles under market
incompleteness. Primarily, we focus on the heterogeneity in the cost among
different skill groups. Unskilled workers are subject to a much larger risk
of unemployment during recessions than are skilled workers. Moreover,
unskilled workers earn less income, which limits their ability to
self-insure. We examine how this heterogeneity in unemployment risk and
income translates into heterogeneity in the cost of business cycles. We find
that the welfare cost of business cycles for unskilled workers is
substantially higher than the welfare cost for skilled workers.
