Title: A Tale of Tax Policies in Open Economies
Abstract:   Recent financial crises in Europe as well as the periodic battles in the
  U.S. over the debt ceiling point to the importance of fiscal discipline
  among developed countries. This paper develops an open economy model,
  calibrated to the U.S. and a subset of the EMU, to evaluate the impact of
  various permanent tax changes. The first set of experiments considers a
  targeted one percentage point reduction in the government deficit-to-GDP
  ratio through raising one of: the consumption tax, the labor income tax,
  or the capital income tax. In terms of welfare, the consumption tax is
  found to be the least costly of the tax increases. A second set of
  experiments looks at deficit-neutral tax changes: partially replacing the
  capital income tax with either a higher labor income tax or higher
  consumption tax; and partially replacing the labor income tax with an
  increased consumption tax. Reducing reliance on capital income taxation
  is welfare-enhancing, although it leads to short term losses. Reducing
  labor income taxation improves international competitiveness and is
  welfare-improving.
