Title:  Stable International Environmental Agreements: An Analytical Approach
Abstract:  In this paper we examine the formation of International Environmental
Agreements (IEAs). We show that the welfare of the signatories does not
increase monotonically with respect to the number of signatories. We provide
an analytical solution of the leadership model. In particular, we find that the
unique stable IEA consist of either two, three or four signatories if the number
of countries is greater than 4. Furthermore, we show that the welfare of the
signatories is almost at its lowest level when the IEA is stable. While in our
where the choice variable is abatement efforts.
