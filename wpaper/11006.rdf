Title: The Household Revolution: Childcare, Housework,and Female Labor Force Participation
Abstract: Over the twentieth century, the amount of time that
married women devoted to working in the market increased dramatically.
This paper explores the implications for the allocation of womens' time
stemming from: (1) the durable goods revolution associated with the
introduction of new technologies, from running water to modern appliances,
that significantly reduced the time demands of home production; (2) the
increase in the relative wage of women, from roughly $50$\% to over $80$\%;
and (3) changes in childcare requirements associated with changes in
fertility patterns.  To do so, we construct a life-cycle model with home
production and childcare constraints.  The parameters of the childcare
production function are chosen to match micro evidence from U.S.\@ time use
data.  We find that the increase in the relative wage of women is the most
important explanation of the increase in married womens' market work time
over the twentieth century.  Increases in relative wages and decreases in
fertility can also explain a large part of the observed decrease in
housework.  The model finds that the the declining price of durable goods
has an appreciable effect only since 1980.
