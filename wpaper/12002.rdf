Title: Big Locational Differences in Unemployment Despite High Labor Mobility
Abstract: Considerable labor mobility exists across U.S. states,
enough that, if migration arbitrages local unemployment, one might
expect very low unemployment differences across states. However,
cross-state data reveal large unemployment differences. An equilibrium
multi-location model with stochastic worker-location match
productivity and within-location trading frictions can account for
these facts. In the model, some workers move to, or stay in, a
location with high unemployment because they are more productive there
than elsewhere. According to the model, labor mobility and aggregate
unemployment are negatively related. This prediction is in stark
contrast to standard sectoral reallocation theory, but consistent with
the U.S. data.
