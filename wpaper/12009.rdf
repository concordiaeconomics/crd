Title: A Tale of Tax Policies in Open Economies
Abstract:   Tax-based deficit reduction experiments for the U.S.\@ and EMU-12 are
  conducted using an open economy model.  In welfare terms, raising the
  consumption tax is the least costly, followed by the labor income tax,
  then the capital income tax. Use of an open economy model means that the
  incidence of the consumption tax is borne in part by foreign producers.
  Among revenue-neutral tax experiments, partially replacing the capital
  income tax is welfare-enhancing, although there are short term
  losses. Replacing labor income tax revenue with a consumption tax
  improves international competitiveness and is welfare-improving.
